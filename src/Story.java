 * CAUTION! You MUST read The Pen of Doom (El Bolígrafo de la Perdición), The
 * Tale of Lava Face and Sausage Legs, Art-third and the Cheese Grater of
 * Righteousness, and, of course, Hermetfleas. Hello, user. I am Narrator. I
 * couldn’t care less about your name, so don’t waste your time. This story is
 * about a man-fish kinda thingy. You’ll understand when you see him. Anyways,
 * his name is Pierre. He always looked up to his hero Hermetfleas, the ugly guy
 * who made Fleece important by killing Appleham Limburger. Pierre was a very
 * passive - *screams at squirrel approaching* - check that, timid kind of a
 * guy. One day, he heard from a man named Sausage Legs that Hermetfleas was in
 * trouble. Their conversation went somewhat like this: “AAAAAAAA!” Pierre
 * savagely said. ”AAAAAAAAAA!” Sausage Legs retorted in a truly magnificent
 * fashion. This went on until the concept of Hermetfleas. In rough translation
 * from scream to English, Larry betrayed Hermetfleas for something
 * unidentifiable (Youtubers, put that in your Top Ten Anime Betrayals videos),
 * and Hermetfleas was wallowing in his Fortress of Solidtoot in Toto, Africa.
 * So, they resolved to find Larry and tell him Hermetfleas’ most famous quote,
 * which would also serve as their battle cry: “HURRRRRR?”
